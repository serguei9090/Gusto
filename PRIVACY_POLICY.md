- Providing and maintaining the Application.
- Processing payments for optional subscriptions.
- Communicating with you regarding updates, support, or security alerts.

## 5. Security of Your Information

We implement reasonable security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information. However, please be aware that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.
